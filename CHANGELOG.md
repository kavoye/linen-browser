# Changelog

## 0.7.0

### New

  entries in Settings > Autofill. Passwords and cards require system
  authentication. You can also use a password manager extension.

### Improved

  demand. A context indicator shows estimated usage.

  settings. Advanced options are under Developer Settings.

  showing an empty list.

## 0.4.2

### Improved

  them instead of pushing them down, and a line separates the two groups.

  normal web page.

  list of them.
- The loading bar now runs the full width of the page.
- The selected thinking level now appears beside the Thinking heading.

  page.

## 0.4.0

### New

  thread. Choose the provider, model and reasoning level below the message field.
- The assistant can ask for clarification. Answer it, skip
  the question, or let the assistant choose.

  your message and send it back.

- Settings, History, Downloads, Release Notes and new tabs have addresses, so
  Back and Forward work with them.

- Settings > Extensions lists the Safari extensions on your Mac, and each
  profile keeps its own.
- Settings > Advanced > Feature flags lists WebKit feature flags,
  with search and a reset.
- Extensions from the Chrome Web Store update themselves once a day. Check for
  Updates in an extension’s menu checks right away, and an update that asks for
  more access waits for you.
- Your downloads stay in the list after you quit. Settings > Downloads decides
  when the list empties.

### Improved

- Switching profiles is five to eight times faster.
- Restored background tabs load only when opened, reducing startup time for
  large sessions.
- The profile switcher opens beside its button in the sidebar, and every profile
  icon is a circle.
- The downloads button is always in the sidebar, and a file you download flies
  from where you clicked it into the button.
- Settings is built from one set of rows. Nothing lights up under the pointer,
  every card shares a surface, and anything that opens a page is a row with a
  chevron rather than a button.
- A setting that is off because another setting is off tells you which one, and
  takes you there.
- Block known trackers moved to Settings > Privacy.
- Keep loaded for a website is now Keep this website awake.
- Each settings page keeps its own action, such as Reset, Remove All or Delete
  Profile, next to the button that takes you back.

  and the title takes the room they leave.

- A tab could display the color of another website’s icon.
- The address bar showed nothing while it checked a connection.

## 0.3.1

### New

- Window style in Settings > Appearance sets how the toolbar and the sidebar are
  displayed. Standard uses an opaque background; Liquid Glass uses a
  translucent one. Glass transparency offers Clear to show more of the desktop
  and Tinted for stronger text and control contrast.

### Improved

- Match website color is now Website tint, and Refract tab color is now Tint
  selected tab. Both are off by default.
- Appearance now comes before Search in Settings.

### Fixed

- The pages you had open in one profile were added to another profile’s history

- The assistant still remembered what you asked it in the profile you left.

## 0.3.0

### New

  side panel and Settings.
- The window uses a tint from the current website. Turn off
  Match website color in Settings > Appearance to keep Linen’s usual Light or
  Dark theme instead.
- Turn on Refract tab color in Settings > Appearance, and the selected tab takes
  on the color of that website’s icon.

  choose.

- Sleep inactive tabs in Settings > General frees memory when your Mac runs low.
  It is off by default.
- The address field is now on every page, including a new tab.
- Website Settings is now a compact panel. It holds page zoom, assistant access,
  tracker blocking, and the camera, microphone, location and notification
  choices for the website you are on, and its tracker details show which known
  tracker domains Linen found on the page.

### Improved

- Type `@` in the address field to point the assistant at one of your tabs. The
  list of tabs opens as soon as you type it, with your question at the top.
- You can make the window much narrower, and websites switch to their compact
  layouts when you do.
- Tabs slide behind the top of the sidebar instead of fading away.
- The side panel shows a music note only when lyrics are available.
- The edges you drag to resize the sidebar and the side panel are easier to see.
- Settings uses lighter shadows and less prominent highlights.
- Removing an extension is now a button in a menu beside it, along with that
  extension’s own settings.

### Fixed

- A tab’s title moved when it started playing sound.
- The color of the window changed a moment after you picked a tab.
- Some dark websites left the window light, and some did not color the window
  until you reloaded them.
- ⌘← and ⌘→ went back or forward while you were editing the address field
  instead of moving through its text.
- Website Settings could be difficult to read over a busy or dark page.

## 0.2.0

### New

- Linen shows synced lyrics for the current song. Open them from the media
  player, from View > Show Lyrics, or with ⌥⌘Y. Adjust text size and timing,
  or choose a different match. Only the song and artist names leave your Mac, and
  never from a private tab. Turn this off in Settings > General.
- Activity and Lyrics now share one panel on the right. One button in the
  toolbar opens it, and the arrows widen it to fill the window.
- A button in the address field sends the video you are watching to a floating
  window. Turn on Automatic Picture in Picture in Settings > General and the
  video opens in Picture in Picture when you leave the tab and returns when
  you reopen it.
- The media player follows whichever tab is playing, so you can pause or skip
  from anywhere.
- Settings > Experiments contains features in development. They may change or
  be removed.
- Import bookmarks from another browser. Export a bookmarks file from
  Safari, Chrome, Firefox or Edge, then choose it in Settings > General.

  page.

### Improved

  else about the assistant.

- Settings and History slid in when they had not moved.

## 0.1.1

### New

- Settings > About lets you follow Preview builds instead of waiting for the
  next release. You can go back to Release at any time.
- Install in the update banner downloads and installs the update without a
  second confirmation.
- The notes for a new version open in a tab after it arrives. To read them
  again, choose Linen > Release Notes.
- ⌃⇥ returns you to your last tab, the way ⌘⇥ returns you to your last app. Hold
  ⌃ and press ⇥ to select the next tab, or ⇧⇥ to select the previous tab.
- Click the orb and talk. Linen sends what you said once you stop. Click the orb
  again while the assistant is working to stop it.
- In the command palette, ⌘↩ asks the assistant about what you typed, and ⇧↩
  searches in a new tab.

### Improved

- The assistant can continue long conversations that exceed its context limit.

### Fixed

- A pasted link brought its styling into the address field.
- A tab kept spinning after going back.
- The scroll wheel moved the page behind the command palette.

## 0.1.0

First release. Linen is a browser for macOS 26 and later.

### The assistant

- The assistant works in the tabs you already have open. It searches, opens
  websites, reads them, clicks, types and scrolls.
- Ask in the address field, or hold ⌥Space and speak. Click the page to stop the
  assistant and use it yourself.
- It asks you first before it buys, sends or signs in, and never fills in a
  password or a card number.

### Models

- Apple Intelligence runs on your Mac without an API key.
- Or add your own key for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, Groq, Mistral,
  OpenRouter or xAI.
- Or connect Linen to a local server, such as Ollama or LM Studio.

### The browser

- Tabs, folders, pinned tabs and split view.
- Profiles and private browsing.
- A command palette, history and find in page.
- Downloads that resume, and zoom you set for each website.
- Extensions from the Chrome Web Store.

### Before you start

- This is an early release. What Linen saves to disk can still change between
  versions.
- Linen opens one window at a time, and does not yet fill in passwords or show
  web notifications. See the README for limitations.
